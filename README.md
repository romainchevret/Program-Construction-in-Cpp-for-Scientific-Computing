# C++ assignments

This repository is a gathering of the assignments in C++ realised during my exchange at KTH (September 2024 - January 2025).

These assignments were carried out in tandem with Ana√Øs Durin.

The repository is composed of 4 assigments respectively concerning :

- Adaptative Integration and Unit testing
- Spatial search with bucket quadtrees
- "4 sided domains" and structured grid
- Stochastic simualtion with parallelization
